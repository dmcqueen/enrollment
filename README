Project Goals

1. Demonstrate Single Table Inheritance.
     Build a hierachy of User types with various one-to-many and many-to-many associations between the subclasses and Courses and Periods.

2. Use Unintrusive JS and HTML5 for AJAX
     Utilize the new Rails JQuery library jquery_ujs.js and the HTML5 data-remote attribute to cleanly implement AJAX.

3. Create a LaunchPad
     Give the world a working demo on Heroku and a repo on GitHub. Thats how we do in "twenty one two".
